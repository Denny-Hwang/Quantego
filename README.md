# Quantego
Quantego is a Lego model of the IBM Quantum System One quantum computer

It has been mentioned first on LinkedIn in December 2021 https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6875070856679231488/ and again in April 2022 https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6920362102687723520/ .

As there were a few requests for a list of the parts, this GitHub repo features a slightly simplified version made of 20 bricks.

Optional modifications might be to replace some of the 2x4 bricks (step 3) by 2x2 bricks to improve stability of the rack, or to replace the 8x8 bricks (step 2 and step 5) by 2x4 bricks which might be easier and cheaper to buy. In that case, 2x4 tiles can be added to improve stability of the top and base.

In case you modify the model - or build you own quantum computer model - please let us know by creating an issue or pull request.
